Fix: Add comprehensive error handling to prevent black screen on startup

## Problem
App showed black screen on Android devices after installation due to
initialization failures that weren't being caught or handled.

## Root Causes
1. Async initialization in main() could hang without feedback
2. No error handling for JustAudioBackground.init()
3. SharedPreferences and AudioService could timeout
4. No loading indicator for users
5. App would crash silently on any init failure

## Solution Applied
1. **main.dart**
   - Wrapped entire main() in runZonedGuarded for critical error catching
   - Added try-catch blocks for all initialization steps
   - Added comprehensive debug logging with emoji indicators
   - Graceful degradation - continues even if features fail

2. **SafeHomePage** (new wrapper)
   - Shows loading screen during initialization
   - 5-second timeouts on each provider initialization
   - Displays error messages if something fails
   - "Retry" button for recovery

3. **LoadingScreen** (new screen)
   - Shows initialization progress
   - Displays detailed error messages
   - User-friendly error recovery

4. **AudioService improvements**
   - 3-second timeout on each audio file load
   - App continues without audio if loading fails
   - Better error logging

## Expected Behavior
- **Before**: Black screen, no indication of what's wrong
- **After**: Loading screen → either main screen OR error message with details

## Testing
- ✅ Flutter analyze: No issues found
- ✅ Code compiles successfully
- Ready for GitHub Actions build

## Files Changed
- lib/main.dart (added error handling)
- lib/screens/loading_screen.dart (new file)
- lib/services/audio_service.dart (added timeouts)
